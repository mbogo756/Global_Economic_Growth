# üåç Global Economic Growth & Climate Dashboard (1973 ‚Äì 2021)

¬∑ Interactive Power BI report exploring worldwide economic growth and temperature change from 1973 to 2021.
¬∑ It combines UN country data with NASA global-temperature records to reveal how population, GDP, and land area relate to rising global temperatures.

## üìù Project Overview

This dashboard analyzes global economic trends and their relationship with climate change.
Users can explore country-level indicators‚ÄîGDP, population, GDP per capita, population density, and land area‚Äîwhile comparing them to NASA‚Äôs global temperature data across nearly five decades.

### ‚ú® Features & Highlights

*Problem Statement*

  ¬∑ Examine how global economic growth correlates with changes in global temperature.

*Dashboard Goals*

¬∑ Provide a worldwide view of GDP, population, and GDP per capita trends.

¬∑ Enable analysis of how climate change (temperature anomalies) intersects with economic indicators.
